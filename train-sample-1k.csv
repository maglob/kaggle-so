I currently generate the tags using the command

    ctags -e -R --tag-relative=yes --langmap=verilog:.v.vh.sv.svh 

My code contains a lot of `define macros which are all specified in certain header files with extension "".vh"" & "".svh"". For e.g. a header file named **foo.vh** has the following code

    `define WIDTH_ADDRESS 32;

and a file **top.v** invokes the macro as follows

    input [`WIDTH_ADDRESS - 1 : 0] InAddress;

While browsing the **top.v** file using emacs, is there any way by which I can jump directly to to the macro definition in the **foo.vh** file?

I have been using `M-x tags-search <RET> WIDTH_ADDRESS <RET>` for sometime now but it jumps to quite a few other instances of `WIDTH_ADDRESS in other files before reaching the foo.vh file.

After some research I did see an option to specify header files using `-h` option with ctags during tags generation. However I could not get it to work and I guess there was some syntactical error from my part.

First of all are there any notable benefits of specifying a header file using `-h` option? If so, what is the correct syntax to specify header files? Also can I specify emacs to look into these header files first (files with extension "".vh"" &"".svh"")  before parsing other files (with extension "".v"" & "".sv"")",emacs,verilog,ctags,system-verilog,exuberant-ctags,,open

Typically what I've done up until now when in this situation is create a staging area for the data that needs to be imported (essentially a temporary table just for storing the data until I'm done merging). I copy _all_ of the data that _might_ be needed from the source to that staging area. Then I merge the data as I would if the two tables were connected, meaning of course that I can filter out whatever data I don't need at that time.

Here's the problem in my current case. The source table is _extremely_ large and entirely _un-indexed_ (something over which I have no control, ugh). That means it takes **forever** to get the necessary data if I don't filter it in some way. In addition the destination table really only needs a relatively small subset of the data to do what it needs to do, maybe ten thousand or so distinct rows at a time.

And I realize that I do not really know what a .png file is. .bmps are just uncompressed bitmaps, .jpgs are bitmaps compressed using the special jpeg algorithm, and I thought .pngs were just bitmaps compressed losslessly using some special png algorithm.

However, it turns out .pngs can be indexed colors like gifs (still losslessly?) and Adobe Fireworks can make special ""Fireworks PNG""s which are editable, letting the user drag and drop stuff around the image a.l.a. MS Word document but still allowing them to be readable by ""standard"" image processing stuff (browsers, paint.net, etc.) as a normal .png.

What gives? Clearly there is way more to the .png format than just losslessly compressed bitmaps.",image,compression,png,format,fireworks,11/12/2011 19:04:15,off topic

We solved a problem.  I’m sure old media server hounds know about this.  I didn’t.  I hope this saves you time in the future.

Problem: My customer’s Shoutcast listing went away but their provider didn’t. (Shoutcast has listings for many stations as a convenience.  My customer’s used to be: 
http: //yp.shoutcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.pls?id=3012xxx and then it went away!  Their station didn’t.

We were left with several URLs provided us by the station and none of them played via our player.  Within each .pls, .ram file, the same URL was listed (see note) - something like this:

http: //74.53.186.162:9082/

How did we solve the problem?

On the Shoutcast console page above, there is a listen link.  It refers to a URL with a .pls extension.  It also shows the sample rate, number of current listeners, etc.  The URL worked. 

What made this interesting is that file located at that URL actually was a .pls text file with the original URL (something like http: //74.53.186.162:9082/) !

What did I learn?

1. Shoutcast servers know what kind of client is accessing their data.  I would assume the same to be true of IceCast servers.  How did I know?  The circular URL reference.  This means that your player parses text files first much like your browser looks at the mime type.
2. Media player classes that you use in code can be really dumb.  They’re sensitive to mime types, bit rates, extension names, etc.
3. If I have the .pls or other media file, I can use them locally.
4. Hard coded IP addresses are just as bad as they ever were.  Unfortunately, developers don’t have much control over this.

Note: Audio Streams with .pls, .ram, etc are text files that have URLs in them to the actual stream.  The text file has other meta data as well.  If you take the raw URL from the txt file and launch it, you might get a Shoutcast Server interface that gives you stream information that your player might use.  (When viewing a radio station’s website, you can sometimes find the stream URL in the player’s launch parms.  Sometimes they can be different.)",java,android,,,,06/27/2011 17:13:22,not a real question

But, I am looking for a suitable software as a starting point from which to continue programming my desired customizations, so I hope it's close enough.

Here are the requirements, for which I am looking for in a web-based tournament management software:

- Customizable: open-source would be perfect, otherwise at least needs to support plug-ins to support different kinds of sports/games/results/etc.
- Authentication: support for authenticated users that can be related to different tournaments as well as teams
- Runs mostly non-supervised: as the tournaments are web-based I'd like to give contestants the possibility to sign-up themselves (based on authentication system to reduce the spamming problem) and report results themselves. Result reports vary dramatically based on the actual tournament, hence, may require some result determination plug-ins. The goal is to reduce the required manual effort by administrators.
- Web interface: I am not interested in off-line tournament management software
- Active: If in any way possible I'd like to build upon software that is maintained and/or in active development

Some optional nice-to-have features would be:

- automatic bracket generation with selectable algorithms (round-robin, KO system, etc)
- visualizations (mainly brackets)
- statistics




I am asking this question after a few hours of researching alternatives I could find. I will list the tools here that I found and what is wrong with them for my purposes. Please feel free to help me improve my google-fu, or point out if I have overlooked something in my evaluations.

- open tournament system: looks roughly like what I had in mind, but never seems to have taken off and is unmaintained for almost half a decade now
- KMleague: also sounds nice, but doesn't appear to be maintained anymore (I couldn't get access to their forums for more information either. Never received the activation e-mail.) Maybe someone here knows it and whether it's worthwhile to check out the code as a starting point.
- In this [SO thread][1] I found Tourney logic and TournamentAPI, which both require off-line management of the tournaments. Additionally, the first is commercial and the latter hasn't released anything yet.

Several commercial products I quickly dismissed for their lack of customizability (most are strictly limited to a certain sport/game) and because all I came across where again off-line managed.

These ellipses can be repositioned within the frame when the user drags them. Clicking on an ellipse causes the text to become editable: a carat appears, highlighting a substring is possible, etc.

I've got the basic structure set up: the 'ellipse' is a self-contained component, with methods called on it from the containing JFrame and its listeners. I've tried two approaches:

1. in the component's draw() method, use a TextLayout to find bounds, position the contained text within the ellipse, and draw it to the frame using TextLayout's draw(). This is fast. Dragging the components around in the JFrame, mouse-over and mouse-click behavior are all straightforward. However for the editing functionality it looks like I will need to write a lot of custom code to handle hit testing, carat positioning, text highlighting, line wrapping, etc.

2. having the component contain a reference to the containing JFrame, and adding or repositioning a TextComponent in that JFrame after drawing the ellipse. This has the advantage of all the built-in TextComponent behavior for editing and line wrapping. But the logistics are really sloppy, and positioning the TextComponent becomes messy too - especially when the user drags the component around.

I'm quite possibly thinking about this all wrong. Can anyone suggest a simple way to do this that I haven't yet stumbled across?
